        <h1>EPISODE 3: HELP FROM THE TURKISH GUY</h1>
        <p>
            The more Leo ran around the tram wreck, the more he yearned for someone to come out from somewhere and help him 
            make sense of it all.

            It was at this time that the ‘Open’ sign of the late-night Turkish cafe across the street beckoned at him, bright 
            and red. The young man sprinted towards it. 
            
            He was going to find a friendly Turkish guy behind the counter, ready to put a chicken thigh into the oven for 
            Leo’s usual ‘Hähnchen keule mit pommes’ order. Leo was going to address the man with the best broken German he 
            could muster, “Nein! Ich brauche keine Hähnchen! Hast du die nightmare outside sehen?”
            
            Leo found the Turkish guy behind the counter, alright. He was crumbled up in a heap of flesh and bones, though, 
            dead. The kebab machine ran still. Sweet Turkish music was in the air.
            
            There were two more corpses inside by the gaming machines, an elderly woman and a teenager who had run out of 
            luck for one final time. Leo felt himself get to the brink of madness.</p>
