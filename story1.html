        <h1>EPISODE 1: A GOOD DAY</h1>
        <p>Twenty-two year old Leo Tasara woke up at eight am, like always,  put on some Edvard Grieg, and jumped under the 
            shower.

        “It’s gonna be a great day, motherfuckers,” he shouted as he waltzed to the music, creaming himself up with lotion.
        
        A science and society class on the history of computing was to kickstart the morning, followed by an inspiration-finding 
        group field trip to a handful of Berlin’s ceramics stores.
        
        However, Leo was most excited about lunch. He was to meet up with a friend who had just come back from a “spectacular” 
        exchange semester in Silicon Valley.
        
        “It’s gonna be a wonderful day, man,” Leo repeated.
        
        A few moments later, he was shouting at his neighbour’s door.
        
        “Amir, dude, are you coming or what?”
        
        There was no answer. Today was probably one of those days where weed was in and people and school were out.
        
        “If you came all the way from Iran to smoke your life away here, then by all means, man!”
        
        Finished, Leo walked out into the most bizarre day of his life thus far.</p>
